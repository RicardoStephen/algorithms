Unittest

Suggestions for the future (unittest)
+ Start with simple tests without subtests before adding more rigorous tests
  with multiple subtests.
+ A dictionary of arbitrary strings and a seeded rng would have been pretty
  useful.
+ Tests need to be better modularized like those in test_hashset.py.

TODO
+ TestHashMap.test_str, TestHashSet.test_str (requires regex)

Known issues (unitttest)
+ Test case inheritance has been implemented poorly. When TestDeque is run,
  tests it inherits from TestLinkedList run twice.
+ Test methods do not need to clean up objects created by setUp and used by
  other test methods in the same test case - it appears that setUp is called
  before each test method is run (perhaps unittest creates a new TestCase
  instance per test method).
